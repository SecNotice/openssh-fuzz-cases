These are testcase inputs for fuzzing parts of OpenSSH using Michal
Zalewski's afl-fuzz[1].

They are all pretty disorganised now, but I'm saving them for future
use in detecting regressions. There are some basic scripts to drive
fuzz sessions inside tmux.

If you want to use these, don't forget to patch sshkey.c to ignore
signature errors. The disable-signature-verify.diff patch does this.
